# 🎮 Level Up – Online Game Store  

## 📌 About the Project  
**Level Up** is a front-end web project designed as an online game store.  
The goal is to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly platform where users can browse, explore, and connect through games.  

This project was built as part of my **Front-End Web Development Capstone**.
